          After seven years in the massage industry, I've learned that not everyone is looking for a spa experience.
          What they really want is someone who will listen to their needs and aid in recovery from chronic stress and
          tightness. Whether you're an athlete who needs to recover from pushing your body to the limits or an office
          worker forced to live a sedentary lifestyle, my goal is to have you feeling rejuvinated and ready to take on
          life's challenges.

              I’ve seen Solomon for years. As a massage therapist, I am speaking with experience. My most recent massage
              was
              so relaxing! Solomon was helpful and focused on all my muscle problems. He was very knowledgeable with my
              areas of tension, and asked about desired pressure many times during the massage. <br>
              Afterwards, he suggested to get a more regular schedule going, that would benefit my bodies needs. You
              won’t
              regret getting a massage from Solomon.<br>

              I have been to several massage therapists over the years, but Solomon is by far my favorite! He caters the
              massage to my stress points and provides deep tissue massage where needed to alleviate tight knots and
              tension. Regular massage sessions with Solomon have also helped tremendously to reduce my tension
              headaches.
              And he's both professional and personable... it's like being treated by a friend who truly cares!<br>

              I have been scheduling with Solomon for close to two years. I suffer with the chronic condition of
              Fibromyalgia. With regular massages I have all but eliminated my Fibromyalgia flareups.He is a very
              personable therapist I have enjoyed getting to know.<br>

              Solomon is truly amazing! He's knowledgeable, attentive, and always know just the right pressure—whether I
              need something relaxing or deep and therapeutic. On top of that, he is so personable and easy to talk to,
              which makes every session comfortable and enjoyable. I always leave feeling refreshed and cared for.
              Highly
              recommended!<br>

              I have been seeing Solomon for at least five years, and the experience has been nothing short of
              exceptional. From the beginning, I felt completely comfortable, as he is professional, respectful, and
              values privacy. His treatments have made a remarkable difference in my health—my severe migraines and
              chronic back pain have improved significantly since I began seeing him. He is kind, personable, and truly
              listens to his clients’ needs. I have so much trust in his care that even my daughter sees him now. I am
              deeply grateful for the positive impact he has had on our well-being.<br>

              I have trusted Solomon for the past several years to deliver an amazing massage experience. He is
              professional, respectful, and trustworthy. My sessions with him are an important part of my physical and
              mental health. It is my great pleasure to recommend him!<br>
